There are those who believe that life here began out there, far across the universe.
With tribes of humans who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians, or the Toltecs, or the Mayans.
That they may have been the architects of the Great Pyramids, or the lost civilizations of Lemuria, or Atlantis.
Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man, who even now fight to survive... somewhere beyond the heavens.
